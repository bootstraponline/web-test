# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  
  # Run a test using saucectl 
  sauce_ctl_run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2-beta
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm i -g saucectl
      - run: saucectl -v
      - run: saucectl run
        working-directory: sauce/
  
  # Run a test locally using playwright test runner
  local_run:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # npx is shipped as part of node
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2-beta
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install
      # run playwright test in tests/ by setting the working directory.
      - run: npx test-runner --browser-name=chromium
